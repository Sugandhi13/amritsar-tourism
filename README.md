# Credits

I have really enjoyed the Code Institute course up till now, and I am looking forward to the next units of the course. I wanted to thank the Slack Community for their support learning the content and my Mentor Martina for her guidance with this project and assurances that creating a website is not as scary as I initially thought.

As a starting point I looked at the Coders Coffee and Love Running projects.

From the Love Running Project, I took inspiration for the header, hero banner, footer and form.
From the Coders Coffee Project, I took inspiration from in my 'What we do?' section.
