# Testing

The site has been tested on a variety of mobile devices as well as different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and all links, 
images and the contact form functioned as it should. All input fields of the contact form function correctly, and require the requested 
input fields before submitting.

I personally tested the site extensively with Google Chrome dev tools to ensure the site works responsively not only on mobile devices 
but also on medium to larger screens.

One of the biggest problems I encountered from the beginning handling css on different webpages. Then I took help from Love running 
project as well as w3school and stackoverflow websites (mentioned in credits as well).

Another issue I faced is how to handle cover-text on main image when switching from desktop browsers to mobile browsers as well as 
alignments of navigation menu and footer elements. I've tried my best to fix these issues.

Henceforth, applying media queries has been the biggest challenge during this project.

Some improvements are done on different HTML pages after testing them on W3C Validator.

# Validator Testing

# Unfixed Bugs

I've struggled with Media queries and how to handle website on different devices. This website currently looks great on desktop

I will try to improve further on this in coming days and considering it as a challenge to handle.

# Credits

I have really enjoyed the Code Institute course up till now, and I am looking forward to the next units of the course.

this project and assurances that creating a website is not as scary as I initially thought.

As a starting point I looked at the Coders Coffee and Love Running projects.
