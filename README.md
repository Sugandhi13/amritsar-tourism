# Re-submission Comment

I'm resubmitting this project as the media queries didn't behaved as expected during the evalution while checked by the examinar. 
The major problem described by the reviewer that the site is not responsive across tested devices (desktop, mobile, and tablet). 
On smaller devices the footer overlaps other content, and the text on the landing page is very hard to read across multiple columns. 
Therefore the responsiveness severely hamper usability of the website. 

Now I've learn't a bit more and have a better understanding than before when I initially started working on this project. 
I've put my best efforts and used new methods and coding techniques I've learned in last few months in code insititute.

I would like to give additional credits to new Love Running Project added by code institute create by Jo Heyndels. 
This new course helped me to understand how to handle media query in a better way by focusing on mobile first development. 
I have also learned a better way to use fontawesome website to create icons (social media or other types) from text 
that blends well instead of images in web development. Lastly, I've understood now how to compress image without loosing its quality 
much that helps to load images faster when web page loads as well as looks better without much distortions in the image.

After redevelopment, I've performed all the testing on different browsers, laptop, tablet and mobiles etc. The results looks good to me 
and meets my expectation. The footers are no more going over the text on small screens and navigation menu also handled in a better 
way on big and small screens.

I've created an archive folder and kept the all old files (html and css) in that folder.

# Testing

The site has been tested on a variety of mobile devices as well as different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and all links, 
images and the contact form functioned as it should. All input fields of the contact form function correctly, and require the requested 
input fields before submitting.

I personally tested the site extensively with Google Chrome dev tools to ensure the site works responsively not only on mobile devices 
but also on medium to larger screens.

One of the biggest problems I encountered from the beginning handling css on different webpages. Then I took help from Love running 
project as well as w3school and stackoverflow websites (mentioned in credits as well).

Another issue I faced is how to handle cover-text on main image when switching from desktop browsers to mobile browsers as well as 
alignments of navigation menu and footer elements. I've tried my best to fix these issues.

Henceforth, applying media queries has been the biggest challenge during this project.

Some improvements are done on different HTML pages after testing them on W3C Validator.

### UPDATE

I'm resubmitting this project as the media queries didn't behaved as expected during the evalution by the examinar. 
Now I've learn't a bit more and have a bit better understanding than before when I initially started working on this project. 
I've put my best efforts and used new methods and coding techniques I've learned in last few months in code insititute.

I would like to give additional credits to new Love Running Project added by code institute create by Jo Heyndels. 
This new course helped me to understand how to handle media query in a better way by focusing on mobile first development. 
I have also learned a better way to use fontawesome website to create icons (social media or other types) from text 
that blends well instead of images in web development. Lastly, I've understood now how to compress image without loosing its quality 
much that helps to load images faster when web page loads as well as looks better without much distortions in the image.

After redevelopment, I've performed all the testing on different browsers, laptop, tablet and mobiles etc. The results looks good to me
and meets my expectation. The footers are no more going over the text on small screens and navigation menu also handled in a better
way on big and small screens.

# Unfixed Bugs

I've struggled with Media queries and how to handle website on different devices. This website currently looks great on desktop 
borwsers but have issues with alignments on other media devices.

I will try to improve further on this in coming days and considering it as a challenge to handle.

### UPDATE

I'm resubmitting this project due to the above unfixed bugs. Now I've learn't a bit more and have a bit better understanding than before when 
I initially started working on this project. I've put my best efforts and used new methods and coding techniques I've learned in last few months
in code insititute.

After redevelopment I faced following warning on index.html and attractions.html page. The warning states to avoide using h1 tag multiple times 
on a webpage as its only for top-level headings. I've fixed this by using h2 or h3 tags and managing the font-size from css to make my text look
as I expected it should be without having this waring in W3C validator. 

Hence, I don't have any known bug as per my understanding left in this project.

# Credits

I have really enjoyed the Code Institute course up till now, and I am looking forward to the next units of the course. 
I wanted to thank the Slack Community for their support learning the content and my Mentor Martina for her guidance with 
this project and assurances that creating a website is not as scary as I initially thought.

As a starting point I looked at the Coders Coffee and Love Running projects.

- From the Coders Coffee Project, I got understanding of how to use Codeanywhere and GitHub to develop website.
- From the Love Running Project, I took inspiration for the header, hero banner, footer and form.
- Wikipedia and Punjab Tourism websites, I have referred these website to create content on my website.

I would like to give additional credits to new Love Running Project added by code institute create by Jo Heyndels. This new course helped me to understand
how to handle media query in a better way by focusing on mobile first development. I have also learned a better way to use fontawesome website to create 
icons (social media or other types) from text that blends well instead of images in web development.
