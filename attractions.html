            <li>Jallianwala Bagh</li>
                <p>
                    The terrible massacre in which British soldiers killed our unarmed Hindu brothers occurred here. 
                    Nobody has ever witnessed such a heartbreaking scenario. 
                    On 13 April 1919, a conference was called at Jallianwala Bagh during the liberation fight. 
                    This was opposite to British rule. 
                    All Indians were joining together to fight for their independence.
                    General Dyer opened fire on unarmed children, women, and people to prevent this. 
                    This proved to be the most terrible crime under British control. 
                    Because of this tragedy, the location became known as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. 
                    It has since been transformed into a lovely memorial and park, but the memories of those times may still be seen here. 
                    There are still bullet traces on the walls and much evidence around here. 
                    Jallianwala Bagh is just one kilometre from the Golden Temple. 
                    You may all come here and see this painful incident. 
                    The Jallianwala Bagh Trust has created and maintains a museum here.

            <li>Wagah Border</li>
                <p>
                    Bagha is a village located between Amritsar and Lahore.
                    Because this village marks the boundary between India and Pakistan, it is known as the Bagha Border across India.
                    A great celebration called Ratri Jagran is being held here for the momentous anniversary of India's Independence Day, 
                    beginning on the night of 14 August.
                    Many visitors and nation lovers come here to observe the soldiers' enthusiasm and patriotism and learn the lesson of
                    patriotism in their lives.
                    People from all around the country attend and participate enthusiastically.

            <li>Maharaja Ranjit Singh Museum</li>
                <p>
                    In 1977, Maharaja Ranjit Singh's summer residence was converted into a museum
                    to provide comprehensive information on Sikh history, culture, and architecture. 
                    The Maharaja Ranjit Singh Museum, a reconstructed version of the Summer Palace,
                    is located in the famous Rambagh Garden in the centre of Amritsar. 
                    The Panorama, a two-story circular tower adjacent to
                    the museum, features excellent paintings representing Maharaja 
                    Ranjit Singh's six important wars. Many remnants of royal
                    lineage are housed at the museum, including arms and armour, century-old coins, 
                    and fine paintings and manuscripts.

            <li>Gobindgarh Fort</li>
                <p>
                    This fort was constructed in honour of Guru Gobind Singh. The fort is known as 
                    Govindgarh Fort, known by the same name throughout India. This fort is made of brick and lime. 
                    Raja Ranjit Singh designed and built this fort in the 17th
                    century. Govindgarh Fort is situated on the shores of Tumbh Lake. 
                    It is reported that an underground tunnel connects
                    from here to Lahore at Khooni Darwaza. General Dyer developed a plot for the 
                    Jallianwala Bagh massacre from this fort.
