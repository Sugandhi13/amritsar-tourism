    <h2>Amritsar- The Holy City</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            Founded in the fifteenth century by Guru Ram Das, the fourth guru of the Sikhs.
            The heritage city of Amritsar is one of the most spiritually significant and historically
            rich cities of India. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            The name of the city has its etymological roots in the Punjabi language and Amritsar
            comes from Amrit Sarovar, which when literally translated from Punjab means of pool
            of nectar. One of the largest cities in Punjab.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amritsar has witnessed one of the significant moments of India’s independence at the
            Jallianwala Bagh. However, Amritsar is not only about that. It is about the culture, food
            and flavour of Punjab.

            Sikh’s prime place of worship, Golden Temple, is in Amritsar. It is the Sikhs’ holiest gurudwara.
            Go on a spiritual tour and feel blissful at the gurdwara, primarily known as Harmandir Sahib.
        </p>
        <p> 
            A visit to Amritsar is incomplete without tasting the authentic cuisines of Punjab. 
            Try Amritsari kulcha and lassi when in the city. 
            Also, sarso ka saag tastes different in Punjab than it does in the rest of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, there are a lot of options for shopping in Amritsar from Phulkari dupattas to carpets to dry fruits.
            Amritsar is a full package for tourists.
